        If there's one Asian cuisine we truly love, it's sushi
        (although dim sum comes a close second). Prepared correctly, sushi can
        be a work of sublime art to both the eyes and the tongue. There's
        nothing quite like the taste of a fresh piece of suzuki (sea bass) or
        salmon artfully combined with special rice and a hint of wasabi
        (Japanese horseradish). "Fresh fish in Brooklyn?" we hear you asking.
        Absolutely. There are several very good sushi restaurants in the area,
        but for our money, Matsu is at the head of the pack.

        On a recent visit, we checked out the specials and were delighted to
        see that escolar, a mild white fish, was available. The toro, on the
        other had, was sold out, so we had to put it off until another time.
        We ordered a sampling of nigiri (escolar, alabacore, suzuki, and
        smoked salmon), a couple of maki rolls, two bowls of miso soup, and
        gyoza (small dumplings steamed and then pan-fried). While we waited,
        we took a look around at the small dining room, which can seat about
        30 people without making them feel at all cramped; another ten or so
        seats are available at the sushi bar along one side of the dining
        room. Between the intimate feel of the room and its subtle decoration,
        we felt comfortable right away.

        The miso came out first, and was quite good, hot and pungent, perfect
        for a cool evening or whenever you're feeling under the weather. The
        gyoza followed soon thereafter, and were nicely prepared, warm and
        soft without being too greasy or mushy. The meal really got underway,
        though, when our sushi arrived. Each nigiri portion featured a
        generous slice of fish on top of perfectly-sized rice ball, hand-made
        and formed by the chefs. One of the keys to nigiri is the wasabi smear
        between the rice and fish: too much, and it overpowers everything
        else; too little, and the tastes feel bland. Happily, every one of our
        nigiri pieces had exactly the right amount of wasabi to add a subtle
        zing to every mouthful. The maki rolls were also nicely prepared, with
        an appropriate balance of ingredients.

        For dessert, we decided to order strawberry mochi balls, which are
        small spheres of ice cream surrounded by a glutinous rice coating. Our
        order came out with the balls cut in half, which was a particularly
        nice touch since it made the dish easier to share. We ended the
        evening with some sweet sake recommended to us by our serverâ€”a perfect
        note to close out the meal.

        Husband-and-wife team Scott and Brenda Kim, who opened up Matsu in
        late 2000, are there almost every day of the week and help make every
        customer feel at home. When we returned on a later night, we were
        immediately recognized and greeted almost like family. The servers
        generally keep a close eye on the tables, which is one benefit of the
        limited seating. Scott is often behind the sushi bar, tending to
        orders himself, or else in the kitchen doing the same. Brenda, as
        hostess, oversees the servers and seating with efficiency and charm.

        If you're looking for a good Japanese experience but can't foot the
        bill for a flight to Tokyo, then Geido is an excellent backup plan.
        We'll be back again soon. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit,
